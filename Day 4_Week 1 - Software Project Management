3. Compare and contrast Agile and Waterfall methodologies. What are the main advantages and disadvantages of each?
Waterfall is best suited for projects with clearly defined requirements and no expected changes. It's structured, predictable approach works well when the project scope is unlikely to evolve.
Agile is more suitable for dynamic and complex projects where requirements may change frequently and stakeholders need to see working prototypes or receive continuous feedback.

Waterfall Methodology
Advantages:
a. Clear Structure - It’s easy to understand the process and timeline upfront.
b. It can be more predictable in terms of scope, cost, and deadlines, especially for projects with well-defined requirements.
c. Works well for projects with fixed requirements that are unlikely to change.
Disadvantages:
a. Difficult to accommodate changes once the project is underway.
b. Late Testing can lead to the discovery of serious issues too late.
c. Since feedback is limited, there’s a higher chance of the final product not meeting user needs or market conditions.

Agile Methodology
Advantages:
a. Flexibility - Agile allows for changes in scope and requirements throughout the project, adapting to new insights or market shifts.
b. Continuous Feedback - Stakeholders are regularly involved, providing ongoing feedback, which helps to ensure the product meets user needs.
c. Faster Time to Market - Agile delivers working software incrementally, allowing for parts of the product to be used or tested before the project is complete.
Disadvantages:
a. Due to the iterative nature, it can be harder to predict exact timelines, costs, and deliverables from the outset.
b. Agile requires frequent collaboration and feedback from stakeholders, which can be time-consuming and sometimes difficult to maintain.
c. The flexibility of Agile can lead to continuous changes and additional features being added, which can threaten the project’s timeline and budget if not managed properly.

4. In what types of projects might Agile be more beneficial than Waterfall, and vice versa? Can you provide examples of each?
Agile is more beneficial for dynamic projects which demand continuous stakeholder involvement. It works well in situations where requirements are likely to evolve, and the final product may change over time based on user feedback or market conditions.
Types of Projects for Agile:
- Software development (e.g., mobile apps, e-commerce platforms)
- Startups and innovative products
- R&D and product design
- Customer-centric projects (e.g., website redesigns)
- Game development

Waterfall is more beneficial for projects that have well-defined requirements, a clear and stable scope, and where the deliverables can be planned upfront. It works well in industries where predictability, strict regulations, and adherence to schedules are critical. 
Types of Projects for Waterfall:
- Construction projects (e.g., buildings, infrastructure)
- Manufacturing (e.g., new product lines)
- Compliance-driven projects (e.g., medical device development)
- Large-scale enterprise systems
